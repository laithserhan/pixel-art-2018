- accumulation of small water or ice particles
  - condensation of water vapor
- stratus
  - uniform sheets, low or high in sky
- cirrus
  - look like strands. they blend with the sky
- cumulus
  - go-to clouds for sidescrolling games
  - most defined volumes, best for pixel art with 2 colors
  - cloud faces are irregular? and clearly outlined by sunlight
- nimbus (rainy clouds)
- cirrostratus (both cirrus and stratus)
- stratocumulus (both stratus and cumulus)
- study references
  - pictures
  - clouds outside
- train observation skills
- "when you want to study something, focus on a specific aspect"
  - example: for games, focus only on cumulus clouds and their shape
    - don't need to think about colors, light, volume, and all that stuff all at once

analysis:

- lighting: follow sunlight direction
- values. light vs. dark in cloud vs sky
- color relationships.
- silhouettes and form of cumulus clouds
- shape/rhythm/silhouette
- volume

- sketch out sun direction
- desaturate, color pick values and analyze them
- colors: sky is light at bottom and darker at top
  - more saturated than cloud shadow colors
  - question: need to learn about lightness and saturation and color models
- practice your study with digital painting

- start with shape, blocking
- start with white or black, focus on shape
- fill in light and shadow, details
- smooth out transitions, dithering?

- analyze existing pixel artists' art
- or specific games
  - sword and sorcery
  - owlboy
